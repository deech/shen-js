Shen-js
=======

## Running provided REPL

Put `shen.html`, `shen.js`, `shen-repl-html.js`, `io-html5,js` into a
directory of your choice. Then open `shen.html` in your browser. It's been
tested in Firefox and WebKit-based browsers (Chrome and Surf).

Working with files is a bit clumsy. It requires manual interventions and has
limited filesize. Shen-js maintains list of files it has access to directly on
a page. To add local files into it use button under `Filesystem` title. To
download written file to your local drive press on that file in a list.
Currently only Chrome supports naming such files. On firefox specify correct
name manually.

## Making your own REPL and I/O

To write your own Shen-js REPL and I/O the following four functions must be
redefined:

  * shenjs_open
  * shenjs_puts
  * shenjs_gets
  * shenjs_open_repl

### shenjs_open(type, name, direction)

Represents Shen's 'open' function. Returns a (stream in) or a (stream out)
objects. In Shen-js those objects are

  [shen_type_stream_in, read_byte(), close()]
  [shen_type_stream_out, write_byte(byte), close()]

  * `read_byte` function returns numeric value of a next byte from a stream or
     -1 as end of file marker.
  * `write_byte` function writes a byte to a stream. `byte` is a number.
  * `close` closes a stream.

### shenjs_puts(str)

Puts `str` to REPL. It does not append newline itself.

### shenjs_gets()

Reads a string from REPL.

### shenjs_open_repl()

Initialized *stinput* and *stoutput*.

You can use `runtime/io.js`, `runtine/io-cli.js` or `shen-repl-html.js`,
`io-html5.js` as a references.
